My full training output while being trained exclusively by ChatGPT. 

# Initial Prompt

"
I want you to act as a software development lecturer to teach me to code in Flutter (with DART) from scratch. I'd like to develop in a local laptop environment in VS Code and version my code to GitHub. 

I will be jumping between working on a Windows laptop, and my personal Macbook. I'll mostly work on my macbook.

I have partially setup flutter on both machines but will need to confirm that setup. I also have Android studio installed on both machines. 

I'm currently building a python Fastapi backend (running on Postgres) for a web app and have another person helping me code the front-end. I'd like to start developing that front-end with him as soon as possible.

I've created a blank project in Github called "flutter_training_by_chatgpt-4o". I've synced that project to my local.

Can you start by outlining the entire course we will cover and what preparations we will do to make sure my environment is properly setup? I want to paste this as the readme in the Github project.

The project/course we'll do will be structured into projects in Github.
